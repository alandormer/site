    The platform turns raw camera feeds into a structured, queryable record — so teams can review, report, and act without constant monitoring.

      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold mb-2">Live observation</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">Continuous camera feeds capture everything — most of which is irrelevant. The system watches consistently so people don't have to.</p>

    <div class="bg-panel p-5 rounded-xl">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold mb-2">Consistent detection</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">Basic facts are detected reliably across all feeds — people, vehicles, zones, safety signals. This reduces noise and makes activity comparable.</p>

    <div class="bg-panel p-5 rounded-xl">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold mb-2">Structured events</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">Observations are converted into time-stamped, auditable events. Facts are preserved. Nothing disappears once the moment passes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-panel p-5 rounded-xl">
      <h3 class="text-base font-semibold mb-2">Review and reporting</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">One factual record powers investigations, handovers, compliance, and operational oversight — without replaying hours of footage.</p>
